### snapshot007
## one step back
OK, we'll ignore what is done at snapshot 6, we stick to our service, since I don't have rights to distribute book of Tao, no need to hold it in project within json file.
## some stylinig, at last
Some basic styling, I have to admit. With no intention to study more on how to deal on the final look, given can be, maybe, better than nothing.
