## router
The intention of this app is to emulate book reading.

Consider book, like tao - there is some cover page, then contents, within tao there are books, then chapters and some text. All in all, it not be bad if we had it organized in pages - one for cover/contents, one for each book intro and one for each chapter. And, if we look at service we intend to use - it is already organized in such way.

Then... it is a good moment to introduce router, easy to work with pages in react when we have one.
```
npm install react-router-dom
```
