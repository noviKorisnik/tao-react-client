## project requirements
Sorry, not sure 100%. I am using VS Code as editor/ide, and I think that node is needed to be installed, since we use commands of node package manager...
## start
```
npx create-react-app tao-react-client
cd tao-react-client
yarn start
```
Here we call command to create new react app using template. It takes some time... and after that we have an app, the working app, when started with great spinning animation - nothing left to do if that is what we wanted! Uh well, I wanted something else, so - the next chapter is here.
